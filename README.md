<!-- Your Name and Introduction -->
# Hello, I'm Ali Hamza

I'm a passionate software developer. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share my projects and contributions to the community.
I am a highly motivated and skilled professional with expertise in the
MERN stack, including Node, Express, React.js, and MongoDB. My
proficiency extends to Linux, Docker, Jenkins, GitHub, AWS Cloud
Practitioner, Python, and Java/JavaScript. In a recent project, I developed
a top-notch Final Year Project (FYP) Management Portal using the MERN
stack and automated pipelines with Python scripting. Additionally, I successfully created a functional Learning
Management System (LMS) using JavaFX. My commitment to excellence
is further demonstrated by my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner
certification.
